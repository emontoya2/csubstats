\usage{
games.howell(grp, obs)
}
\arguments{
\item{grp}{A factor or vector indicating group membership for each observation.}

\item{obs}{A numeric vector of observations corresponding to the groups in \code{grp}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{groups}{A character string indicating the pair of groups compared (formatted as "group1 : group2").}
\item{Mean Difference}{The difference in means between the two groups.}
\item{Standard Error}{The standard error of the mean difference.}
\item{t}{The t-statistic for the comparison.}
\item{df}{The degrees of freedom used in the test.}
\item{p}{The p-value associated with the comparison.}
\item{upper limit}{The upper limit of the confidence interval.}
\item{lower limit}{The lower limit of the confidence interval.}
}
}
\description{
Performs pairwise comparisons between group means using the Games-Howell procedure,
which does not assume equal variances or equal sample sizes. This test is useful
for comparing all possible pairs of groups following an ANOVA.
}
\details{
The function calculates the mean difference, standard error, t-statistic, degrees
of freedom, and p-value for each pairwise comparison between groups. It also computes
the upper and lower confidence limits for the mean differences using the Tukey distribution
(\code{ptukey} and \code{qtukey}). These statistics are then compiled into a data frame.

# Example usage:
set.seed(123)

obs <- c(rnorm(20, mean = 10, sd = 2),
         rnorm(20, mean = 12, sd = 2.5),
         rnorm(20, mean = 14, sd = 3))
