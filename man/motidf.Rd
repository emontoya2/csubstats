\description{
This dataset contains experimental data from a case study examining whether
creativity scores differ based on the type of motivation. Undergraduate students
were randomly assigned to receive either an intrinsic or extrinsic motivation questionnaire.
After completing the questionnaire, each subject wrote a Haiku that was later evaluated
for creativity. The study was designed to investigate if thinking about intrinsic motivations
(i.e., engaging in an activity for its own sake) versus extrinsic motivations (i.e., performing
an activity to earn a reward or avoid punishment) affects creative performance.
