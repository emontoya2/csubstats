\description{
A sample dataset from the K-12 School Shooting Database, which documents instances
where a gun is brandished, fired, or a bullet hits K-12 school property. The data,
covering incidents from January 1970 to November 2022, includes details on the timing,
location, and characteristics of each incident, such as the number of victims, media
attention level, school type, and information on the shooter and weapon used.
}
\details{
This dataset is used to explore relationships between variables such as media coverage,
the number of victims, and the type of weapon used. It also facilitates investigation into
whether the level of media coverage differs by the age group of the shooter. For more detailed
information on variable definitions and methodology, please refer to the
