\title{Daily Air Quality and Meteorological Measurements for 2021}
\format{
A data frame with \eqn{n} rows and 9 variables:
\describe{
\item{PM10}{Numeric. Daily PM10 concentration in micrograms per cubic meter (\eqn{\mu g/m^3}).}
\item{AQI}{Numeric. Air Quality Index value; higher values indicate greater health concerns.}
\item{temp}{Numeric. Daily average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (\eqn{^\circ F}).}
\item{Latitude}{Numeric. Latitude of the monitoring station.}
\item{Longitude}{Numeric. Longitude of the monitoring station.}
\item{windspeed}{Numeric. Daily average wind speed (in knots).}
\item{state}{Character. State where the observation was recorded (e.g., "California").}
\item{county}{Factor or character. County where the measurement was taken (e.g., "Fresno").}
\item{City.Name}{Character. Name of the city or a descriptive label if not located in a city.}

\description{
This dataset contains daily measurements of air quality and meteorological variables
from monitoring stations located in three counties (Kern, Tulare, and Fresno) in California
during the year 2021. It includes data on particulate matter (PM10), Air Quality Index (AQI),
temperature, wind speed, and geographic location, and is used to explore questions such as
whether daily PM10 levels differ by county and how PM10 relates to daily temperature.
}
\details{
The dataset is used in a case study on air pollution to examine:
\itemize{
\item Differences in daily PM10 levels across the three counties.
\item The relationship between daily PM10 levels and temperature.
}

Daily measurements were collected from various monitoring stations and provide a basis
for statistical analysis and graphical summaries. The data also include auxiliary meteorological
information and geographic coordinates, which can be used to contextualize the air quality measurements.
