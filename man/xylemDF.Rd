\item{Species}{Species name of the shrub.}
\item{Family}{Plant family.}
\item{P75}{Water potential at 75 percent loss of hydraulic conductivity (MPa).}
\item{Ks}{Xylem-specific conductivity.}
\item{starch}{Starch content in xylem tissues (\\\%).}
\item{xylem_density}{Density of the xylem tissue (\eqn{dry mass/tissue  volume}).}
\item{fiber_perc}{Proportion of fibers in the xylem tissue (\\\%).}
\item{vessel_perc}{Proportion of vessels in the xylem tissue (\\\%).}
\item{par_perc}{Proportion of parenchyma cells in the xylem tissue (\\\%).}
\item{Pmin}{Minimum dehydration level experienced by the plant (MPa).}
\item{water_storage}{Water storage capacity of the xylem tissue (change in relative water content per MPa).}

\description{
This dataset provides measurements of key xylem traits (e.g., hydraulic efficiency,
mechanical strength, water storage capacity) in 29 shrub species. These data were provided by Dr. Brandon Pratt
for a case study exploring the trade-offs among xylem functions in response to water availability.
}
\details{
This dataset was used to investigate how xylem traits in shrub species relate to plant
performance under varying water availability. In the corresponding case study, principal
component analysis (PCA) was applied to these measurements to identify underlying patterns
and dimensions governing xylem function. The variables represent key aspects of xylem
physiology, including hydraulic efficiency (P75, Ks), energy storage (starch), structural
properties (xylem density, fiber, vessel, parenchyma percentages), and drought tolerance
(Pmin, water storage capacity).
