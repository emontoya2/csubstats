\title{One-Way Analysis of Means with Optional Multiple Comparisons}
\usage{
sfaov(formula, data, conf.level = 0.95, var.equal = TRUE, PWC = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object of the form \code{response ~ predictor} that specifies the dependent and independent variables.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables specified in the formula.}

\item{conf.level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence level for the multiple comparisons (default is 0.95).}

\item{var.equal}{Logical value indicating whether equal variances across groups are assumed (default is \code{TRUE}).
If set to \code{FALSE}, Welch's ANOVA is performed.}

\item{PWC}{Logical value indicating whether to perform post-hoc pairwise comparisons (default is \code{FALSE}).
When \code{TRUE}, Tukey's HSD test is applied if variances are assumed equal, and the Games-Howell test is used otherwise.}
}
\value{
The function prints the ANOVA table, R-squared value, and (if requested) the results of the multiple comparisons to the console.
It does not return a value.
}
\description{
This function performs a one-way analysis of means using a specified formula and dataset.
It computes an ANOVA table assuming equal variances by default, but can also perform Welch's ANOVA
when variances are not assumed equal. Additionally, if requested via the \code{PWC} parameter, the function
conducts post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Tukey's HSD test (for equal variances) or the Games-Howell test
(for unequal variances).
}
\details{
The function first checks that the provided formula contains exactly two variables.
It then extracts and evaluates the corresponding variables from the provided data frame.
A standard ANOVA is performed using \code{aov()}. If \code{var.equal = FALSE}, Welch's ANOVA is computed using \code{oneway.test()}.
The R-squared value is calculated as the ratio of the treatment sum of squares to the error sum of squares.
When \code{PWC} is \code{TRUE}, the function computes multiple comparisons:
\itemize{
\item If \code{var.equal = TRUE}, Tukey's HSD test is performed.
\item If \code{var.equal = FALSE}, the Games-Howell test is applied.
}
}
\examples{
# Example using the built-in iris dataset with equal variances assumption
sfaov(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

# Example using Welch's ANOVA and performing post-hoc comparisons with the Games-Howell test
sfaov(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, var.equal = FALSE, PWC = TRUE)
